Project Title: A Performance Analysis for Monarch Matrices.

## Introduction 

- To compare the performance of training Monarch matrix based transformer models with standard image classifiers.

## Monarch Matrices: 

- Naturally sparse
- Every matrix (transform) can be decomposed into Monarch matrices. (Prop 3.2, Dao et al.)
- Monarch: one of the first sparse training methods to achieve wall-clock speedup while
maintaining quality



## Environment and setup
